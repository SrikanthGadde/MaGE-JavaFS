Scanner class for Inputs

Task 1:
    package com.telstra.pack1;

    import java.util.Scanner;

    public class Main {

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // TODO Auto-generated method stub
            Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
            System.out.println("Enter three numbers ");
            int n1 = sc.nextInt();
            int n2 = sc.nextInt();
            int n3 = sc.nextInt();
            
            int lar1 = (n1>n2)?n1:n2;
            int lar2 = (n3>lar1)?n3:lar1;
            
            System.out.println(lar2);
        }

    }

Operators:
1. Arithmetic operators: + - * / %
2. Relational operators: > < == <= >= !=
3. Logical operators: && || !

If-else statements
For loops
While loops
Do-while loops (menu based stuff)

Subroutines (functions)

Task 2:

    package com.telstra.pack1;

    import java.util.Scanner;

    public class Main {

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // TODO Auto-generated method stub		
            Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
            System.out.println("Enter a number: ");
            int n = sc.nextInt();
        
            int rnum = 0;
            int r;
            
            while(n != 0) {
                r = n%10;
                n = n/10;
                rnum = rnum*10 + r;	
            }
            System.out.println("The reversed number is: "+rnum);
        }

    }
    
(Assignment 2) For Task 2, modify to accomodate negatives and multiples of 10.
    Eg. -1234 => -4321 (Use ternary operators)
        100 => 1
        2500 => 52
        -15600 => -651
        
Task 3  (Assignment 3) Check if a number is armstrong number.

Data conversion (Typecasting)
    -   Integer.parseInt()
    
    A literal assigned to a variable is considered as a double
    
    Implicit casting
    Assigning lower size data type to a higher sized data type
    float f1 = 13.33F;
    double d1 = f1;
    
    Explicit casting
    float f2 = (float) d1;
    int n1 = (int)d1;
    
Task 4 - Find factorial of a number


Do research about the following in Java
1. Call by value
2. Call by reference

Arrays (a collection of group of elements)- data types
    -All elements must be of same type
    -Access elements using index values
    -Index starts from 0
    -Static data structure
    -Memory is allocated contiguously
    

    Operations supported:
    -Insert element
    -Delete element
    -Update element
    -Traverse
    -Search
    -Sort
    
Task 5 - Find min and max element in a given array (ArrayDemo project)

Day 1 Assignment
Assignment - 1
A good program must be time efficient and memory efficient. Performance of a program can be improved by optimizing the code. Optimizing can be done at design level and source code level	

Identify different ways to solve a problem and choose the best algorithm
1.	 Finding a prime number 
2.	To find whether a  number is Armstrong number  
3.	To find  palindrome words in a given string
4.	To remove all the duplicate  elements in an integer array

Assignment – 2
Conduct the Loop Optimisation for the following  source code  to improve the program’s performance.
1.  calculate j*k*l*m*n outside the loop
for (i=1; i<count; i++) { 
	a[i] = i*j*k*l*m*n; 
} 

2.  Read the discountTbl[discount] outside the inner loop and within the outer loop
for (discount = 0; discount < numD; discount++) 
{ 
 for (rate = 0; rate < numR; rate++) 
 { 
     rateTbl[rate] = rateTbl[rate] * discountTbl[discount]; 
 } 
} 

3.  Calculate log(3)^2 outside the loop
for (i=1; i<count; i++) { 
   a[i] = Math.pow(log(i) / log(3), 2); 
} 

Assignment-3

1. What is the result that will be printed out ?
public class Test{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
 float f=(1/4) *10;                 //Compilation error. Assigning double to a float. Use an explicit cast
int i = Math.round(f);              //3
System.out.println(i);              //3
}}

2.
Which of the following are valid declarations?
1. int i = 0XCAFE;                  //Invalid
2. boolean b = 0;                   //Invalid
3. char c = 'A';                    //Valid
4. byte b = 128;                    //Invalid   
5. char c = ""A"";"                 //Invalid

3. 
class Test{
 public static void main(String [] args){
 int x= 2;  
 int y= 1;
 for (int z = 0; z < 5; z++){       //GO THROUGH THE LOOP 5 TIMES
  if (( ++x > 2 ) || (++y > 2)){    
   x++;
 }}
 System.out.println(x + "" "" + y); //Compilation error -> "" + ""
 }
}
What is the output of the program?

IN A CONDITIONAL STATEMENT IF THER IS AN OR BETWEEN TWO OR MORE COMPARISONS, IF THE FISRT IS TRUE, THE LATER CONDITIONS DON'T GET EXCUTED
